# Flashloan
A Flash Loan Smart Contract is a self-contained
program deployed on a blockchain platform (commonly Ethereum or a compatible network) 
that allows users to borrow tokens without the need 
for collateral. Flash loans are typically used for
executing arbitrage opportunities, liquidating undercollateralized
positions, or performing complex financial maneuvers in a single transaction.

The primary concept behind flash loans is that 
the borrowed tokens must be returned, along with any 
fees, within the same transaction. If the borrower
fails to do so, the transaction is reverted, 
ensuring that the lender's capital remains safe.
